- [x] push CI/CD template
- [ ] delete secrets before pushing (meh)
- [ ] fix IAM notes from last week
- [x] forget to lock down private repo

whatever

they keep telling me to read AWS docs... like Iâ€™ve got time for that ðŸ’€

also someone in the Discord said RTFM...

like what does that even mean?? "Reboot The Firewall Manually?" ðŸ’€

now they want me to learn IAM and YAML?? bro I barely passed my HTML cert ðŸ˜©

might just leave this job tbh
